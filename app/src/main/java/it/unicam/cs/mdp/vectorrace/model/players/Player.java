/**
 * Abstract base class representing a player in the Vector Race game.
 * This class provides the common functionality for both human and bot players,
 * managing their state and movement in the game.
 * 
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Position and velocity tracking</li>
 *   <li>Movement history recording</li>
 *   <li>Checkpoint progression tracking</li>
 *   <li>Visual identification (name and color)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The class follows these design principles:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Immutable player identity (name and color)</li>
 *   <li>Protected state for subclass access</li>
 *   <li>Template method pattern for movement decisions</li>
 * </ul>
